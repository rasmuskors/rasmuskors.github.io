               <p class="aboutme"><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>y life journey started from Estonia when I won a scholarship to study IB Diploma in Thailand. For the first time I left my comforts to face the unexplored land. By now I have also studied in <a href="http://english.blcu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Language and Culture University</a> and <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">City University of Hong Kong</a>, pursuing my passion of integrating Asia and Europe with the use of Information Management.<br> 
            <!-- COMMENT-->      My aspiration is to become an analyst in information technology industry, such as data analyst and system analyst. Often I find myself exploring data and instantly drawing a visual image of it, or discovering system related efficiencies to improve organisations. I have initiated some additional personal projects to foster my technical skills, giving me an injection of innovation and new perspectives that I can further use in my work.<br>
                   
                  I started doing sports and competing at the age of 6, that has been in my natural habitat ever since. At the age of 15 I saw the possibilities of digital photos, leading me to work on my own <a href="http://rkors.tumblr.com" target="_blank">photography portfolio</a> with my camera and Photoshop. Later on I got involved with music that lead me to form the band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJsLuK2vO8wkxfGSlJG-vvA/videos" target="_blank">Bad Train Men</a>. Furthermore, in 2014 I initiated and became Project Manager for "Outbound Project" after seeing my favourite beach in a horrible condition, conseqently cleaning it up. 
                  Since the start of my university studies I have continuously searched for job opportunities where I could master my skills further. I can honestly say that I enjoy what I do. You can find my working experience below.
