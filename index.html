For the first time I left my comforts to face the unexplored land. By now I have also studied in <a href="http://english.blcu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Language and Culture University</a> and <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">City University of Hong Kong</a>, pursuing my passion of integrating Asia and Europe with the use of Information Management.<br> 
            <!-- COMMENT-->      My aspiration is to become an analyst in information technology industry, such as digital analyst and business analyst. Often I find myself exploring data and instantly drawing a visual image of it, or discovering system related efficiencies to improve organisations. I have initiated some additional personal projects to foster my technical skills, giving me an injection of innovation and new perspectives that I can further use in my work.<br>
                   
                  I started doing sports and competing at the age of 6, that has been in my natural habitat ever since. At the age of 15 I saw the possibilities of digital photos, leading me to work on my own <a href="http://rkors.tumblr.com" target="_blank">photography portfolio</a> with my camera and Photoshop. Later on I got involved with music that lead me to form the band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJsLuK2vO8wkxfGSlJG-vvA/videos" target="_blank">Bad Train Men</a>. Furthermore, in 2014 I initiated and became Project Manager for "Outbound Project" after seeing my favourite beach in a horrible condition, conseqently cleaning it up. 
                  Since the start of my university studies I have continuously searched for job opportunities where I could master my skills further. I can honestly say that I enjoy what I do. You can find my work experience below.

                 <b>Ice Bucket Challenge: Water Wasted VS Money Raised (and How Much Water it Could Buy)</b>
      <br><br> 
The hype of the #IceBucketChallenge ended in 2014. Within 55 days ALS received a total of USD114M in donations. The trade-off? Water.<br>
I found that the total donation could buy (in the US) approximately 2.2 times the water that was actually "wasted".
Of course it's not all about the money and water, however it's a cool angle to look at it:)
        <br><br>
        To create this visualisation I used: report published by ALSA; number of youtube videos tagged "Ice Bucket Challenge"; average water usage estimation by Jason Ruiz; Circle Of Blue price of water stats; Google SketchUp.

                For <a href="http://www.rossanaestrada.com" target="_blank">this webpage</a> I communicated closely with Rossana to better understand where she currently stands, what makes her stand out, and what she wants to achieve professionally. <br>        
 In the planning process I focused on organising the information, designing the concept and creating the elements that could best represent her. The website is to be launched this August.

        Here I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

            <br> 
                <br>
                Every year there are thousands of searches and rescues launched in popular hiking places with the goal of finding missing hikers.  By creating a standard "help" symbol the person will get noticed and rescued faster as he/she draws the symbol on the ground, or uses a physical symbol product (that includes a QR Code).  <br>  <br>      
As a result of my research the symbol consists of a triangle (mountain) on top, and letter "H" (home/help) at the bottom.
Through the use of <a href="http://www.tomnod.com" target="_blank">satellite images and crowdsourcing</a>, the search for missing people is enhanced. Also, the rescue team can locate the missing hikers faster.
I am driven to save people's lives and making a change in the hiking community as I believe in borderless exploration and life changing adventures, while still remaining safe.

                 <b><p>myRoof: helping newcomers in Hong Kong to find the perfect district to live in.</b>
            <br> <br>
                Hong Kong is small enough to easily get around, however big enough to have distinctive areas and characteristics (Skittles, lets say). For this, I found that by comparing the must-have Skittles the user could receive a valuable holistic view about the surrounding area. This is a different approach that current property agency websites are offering.
                <br> 
                <br>
                The application was created to collage various sources of data to provide a personalised search function. By bringing together various district factors, such as "food price index" and "air pollution index", and letting the user prioritise each factor, the user could receive a district recommendation.<br>  <br>      
  In this app I took up the role of Data Management and UI. Together with a team of 5 the app was written in Android Studio using Java.</p>

            <br> 
                <br>
                 Curiosity drove me to visualise Japan's government debt (highest in the world per person), USD 12+ trillion, in relation to objects. By creating a stack of money where each bill represents US$100 I could better understand the sum of it.
<br><br>
           I believe that mere numbers are not informative enough. People remember and understand facts and figures better when they can be related to oneself. Thus, when presenting this infograph to a Japanese friend of mine, Osaka Tower is clearly a spot-on choice.
